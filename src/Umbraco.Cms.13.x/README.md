## Contentment for Umbraco

### Demo Umbraco website

This is a demo website, using Umbraco v13.0.0, to showcase the features of the Contentment package.

It should be considered as a continual work-in-progress.

It could have the potential to be serve as a starter kit, however it is opinionated, in that it used uSync and ModelsBuilder configurations.

Umbraco version `13.0.0` is intentionally used, as that is the minimum version of Umbraco that the latest version of Contentment supports.

Feel free to use it, modify it, or don't use it, I don't care. Only please don't ask me to support your use of it.


### Installation

The `appsettings.Development.json` is configured to perform an unattended installation, using SQLite database, with the login credentials...

Username: `test@test.com`
Password: `test123456`

uSync has been configured to import all schema/settings and content at start-up. If this doesn't automagically happen, you can try the import feature on the uSync dashboard in the CMS backoffice.


### Contributions

Whilst I am open to contributions, please keep in mind that I am using this demo website is primarily for my own testing purposes, any suggestions would need to serve in my interest.
